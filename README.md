# lembs-datascience-school

## General
Collection of Jupyter notebook created while going through [LemBS Data Science school in 2019](http://lembs.com/dsonline).
Some assignments were not fully completed, so I left them out for a time being (including topics like NLP, Anomaly Detection, Dimensionality reduction and Recommender Systems).

I will upload them if I will ever get to bring them to satisfying result.

## System Requirements
\***.ipynb** files are associated with **JupyterLab** and to comfortly work with them they do require to have following environment installed on your machine:

* **Anaconda Navigator ver. 1.9.12** or higher
* **JupyterLab ver. 0.35.4** or higher
* **Python ver. 2.7.14** or higher. 

**NOTE:** ipynb files can be opened in view mode inside your browser, but some features might be not available (e.g: ToC navigation), or may require prolonged load time. 

## File Structure
File structure should be self-explanatory without any additional comments.
